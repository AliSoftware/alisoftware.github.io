Today's article will be about handling errors in Swift. Because let's be honest, that makes a fun post title for the season ❄️☃️.

## And since we've no place to go

Let it throw, let it throw, let it throw.

## Don't let them in, don't let them see

## Can't hold it back anymore

## The cold never bothered me anyway
