This month, I'm gonna talks at ([NSSpain](http://2016.nsspain.com) and [FrenchKit](http://frenchkit.fr)) about Swift. I'm looking forward to speak at such great conferences, and I really hope to see you there!

# Conferences

In other news, I'm gonna give my first big conference talks. People who know me already know I don't have any problem talking a lot in public ðŸ˜‡ and I've already talked in meetings like CocoaHeads, but that will be the first time I'll speak at a big conference.

For my first time, I already chose a great challenge:

* My first talk will be at [NSSpain](http://2016.nsspain.com) in Spain, on Sept 15-16, 2016 â€” doing **live coding** about Costless abstractions
* My second talk will be at [FrenchKit](http://frenchkit.fr) in France, on the wek right after (Sept 23-24) â€” talking about Mixins.

The first talk will be quite a challenge for me, because it will be my first big conference, speaking in English (not my language), in a foreign country, doing not just slides but mostly live-coding â€” with Swift 3â€¦ so in Xcode 8 beta ðŸ˜± yeah I too like to live dangeroulsy! â€” and about a subject that I haven't talked about yet.

The second one will probably be easier after that first challenge, and also because it will be in my country ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, with slides and not live-coding, and on a subject I already talked aboutâ€¦ but you never know how events could turn once on stage, and especially given how talkative I can be, I hope I'll fit into the 30 minutes window that I've been allocated!

I'm not sure I'm entirely ready, but nevertheless I really can't wait to meet a lot of people there and be part of that. I really enjoyed going to conferences last year as an attendee, so this time going as a speaker I really think this is gonna be even more amazing!

_This also explains why I haven't been very present the last few weeks, quite busy preparing SwiftGen and my talksâ€¦ but worry not, I haven't forgotten about the part 2 of my last article about [Closure Capture Semantics](/swift/closures/2016/07/25/closure-capture-1/) and will hopefully resume my blogging around october!_

I can't wait to see all of you at NSSpain and/or FrenchKit, and if you come to one of these conferences, don't hesitate to come and say hello! ðŸ‘‹
