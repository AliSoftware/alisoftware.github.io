Today's article is a bit different of the others and won't really be technical, but will rather talk about my experience with the OpenSource Community, and how contributing to OpenSource enlightened me.

## OHHTTPStubs

* First component that had success
* Didn't see that coming
* Very comforting and gives assurance

## CocoaPods

* My first dive in Ruby, I didn't know Ruby before
* Don't be afraid
* Welcoming Community

## SwiftGen

* Started as a POC
* Gain success thanks to visibility on Twitter and iOSWeekly

## Dip

* First component on which I gave push access to someone
* Feels great to trust people

## Conclusion

* Open Source is wonderful
* Gives you opportunity to meet wonderful people
* Sharing is very gratifying
* Nice things happen when being nice
