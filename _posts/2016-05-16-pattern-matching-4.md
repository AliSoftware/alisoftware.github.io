Now that we've revisited the various syntaxes for pattern matching in [part 1](http://alisoftware.github.io/swift/pattern-matching/2016/03/27/pattern-matching-1/), [part 2](http://alisoftware.github.io/swift/pattern-matching/2016/03/30/pattern-matching-2/) and [part 3](http://alisoftware.github.io/swift/pattern-matching/2016/04/24/pattern-matching-3/), let's finish this blog post series with some advanced syntax using `if case let`, `for case where` and all!

Let's use what we saw in previous articles and apply them all to some advanced expressions.

## if case let

The `case let x = y` pattern allows you to check if `y` does match the pattern `x`.

Writing `if case let x = y { â€¦ }` is strictly equivalent of writing `switch y { case let x: â€¦ }`: it's just a more compact syntax which is useful when you only want to pattern-match against one case â€” as opposed to a `switch` which is more adapted to multiple cases matching.

For example, let's use an `enum` similar to the one from the previous articles:

```swift
enum Media {
  case Book(title: String, author: String, year: Int)
  case Movie(title: String, director: String, year: Int)
  case WebSite(urlString: String)
}
```

Then we can write this[^tip]:

```swift
let m = Media.Movie(title: "Captain America: Civil War", director: "Russo Brothers", year: 2016)

if case let Media.Movie(title, _, _) = m {
  print("This is a movie named \(title)")
}
```

[^tip]: The order of arguments (pattern vs. variable) in that syntax can be troubling. To remember the order, just think of it as using the same `case let Media.Movie(â€¦)` syntax you use in a `switch`. That way, you'll remember to write `if case let Media.Movie(â€¦) = m` instead of `if case let m = Media.Movie(â€¦)` which wouldn't compile anyway â€” grouping the `case` with the **pattern** (`Media.Movie(title, _, _)`) like you do in `switch`, and not with the variable to compare it to (`m`).

This is equivalent to the more verbose code:

```swift
switch m {
  case let Media.Movie(title, _, _):
    print("This is a movie named \(title)")
  default: () // do nothing, but this is mandatory as all switch in Swift must be exhaustive
}
```

## if case let where

We can combine the `if case let` with a `where` clause of course:

```swift
  if case let Media.Movie(_, _, year) = m where year < 1888 {
    print("Something seems wrong: the movie's year is before the first movie ever made.")
  }
```

That can lead to quite powerful expressions that would otherwise need a complex `switch` and multiple lines only to test one specific case.

## guard case let

Of course, `guard case let` is similar to `if case let`. You can use `guard case let` and `guard case let â€¦ where â€¦` to ensure something matches a pattern and a condition and exit otherwise.

```swift
enum NetworkResponse {
  case Response(NSURLResponse, NSData)
  case Error(NSError)
}

func processRequestResponse(response: NetworkResponse) {
  guard case let .Response(urlResp, data) = response,
    let httpResp = urlResp as? NSHTTPURLResponse
    where 200..<300 ~= httpResp.statusCode else {
      print("Invalid response, can't process")
      return
  }
  print("Processing \(data.length) bytesâ€¦")
  /* â€¦ */
}
```

## for case

Combining `for` and `case` can also let you iterate on a collection conditionally. Using `for case â€¦` is semantically similar to using a `for` loop and wrapping its whole body in an `if case` block: It will only iterate and process the elements that match the pattern.

```swift
let mediaList: [Media] = [
  .Book(title: "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", author: "J.K. Rowling", year: 1997),
  .Movie(title: "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", director: "Chris Columbus", year: 2001),
  .Book(title: "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets", author: "J.K. Rowling", year: 1999),
  .Movie(title: "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets", director: "Chris Columbus", year: 2002),
  .Book(title: "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban", author: "J.K. Rowling", year: 1999),
  .Movie(title: "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban", director: "Alfonso CuarÃ³n", year: 2004),
  .WebSite(urlString: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter-related_topics")
]

print("Movies only:")
for case let Media.Movie(title, _, year) in mediaList {
  print(" - \(title) (\(year))")
}
  
/* Output:
Movies only:
 - Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001)
 - Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)
 - Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)
 - J.K. Rowling: A Year in the Life (2007)
*/
```

## for case where

Adding a `where` clause to that all can make it even more powerful:

```swift
print("Movies by C. Columbus only:")
for case let Media.Movie(title, director, year) in mediaList where director == "Chris Columbus" {
  print(" - \(title) (\(year))")
}

/* Output:
Movies by C. Columbus only:
 - Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001)
 - Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)
*/
```


ðŸ’¡ **Note**: Using `for â€¦ where` without the `case` pattern matching part is also a valid Swift syntax. For example you can write:

```swift
for m in listOfMovies where m.year > 2000 { â€¦ }
```

It is not using pattern matching (no `case` nor `~=`) so that's a bit out of the scope of this article series, but it's still totally valid and as useful as the other constructs presented here â€” as it avoids wrapping the whole body of your `for` within a big `if` (or starting it with a `guard â€¦ else { continue }`).

## Combining them all

Let's finish this series with the Grand Finale: combine all that we learned from the beginning (including some syntactic sugar like `x?` we learned in the previous article):

```swift
extension Media {
  var title: String? {
    switch self {
    case let .Book(title, _, _): return title
    case let .Movie(title, _, _): return title
    default: return nil
    }
  }
  var kind: String {
    // Remember part 1 where we bind all the associated values in one single anonymous tuple `_`?
    switch self {
    case .Book(_): return "Book"
    case .Movie(_): return "Movie"
    case .WebSite(_): return "Web Site"
    }
  }
}

print("All mediums with a title starting with 'Harry Potter'")
for case let (title?, kind) in mediaList.map({ ($0.title, $0.kind) })
  where title.hasPrefix("Harry Potter") {
    print(" - [\(kind)] \(title)")
}
```

This look might look a little complex, so let's split it down:

* It uses `map` to transform the `Array<Media>` array `mediaList` into an array of tuples `[(String?, String)]` containing the title (if any) + the kind of item (as text)
* It only matches if `title?` matches â€” which is syntactic sugar to say if `.Some(title)` matches â€” the `$0.title` of each media. This means that it discards any media for which `$0.title` returns `nil` (a.k.a. `Optional.None`) â€” excluding any `WebSite` in the process, as those don't have any `title`)
* Then it filters the results to only iterate on those for which `title.hasPrefix("Harry Potter")` is true.

So in the end this will loop on every medium that has a title starting with "Harry Potter", discarding any medium that don't have a title â€” like `WebSite` â€” as well as any medium having a title that doesn't start with `"Harry Potter"` â€” excluding the J.K. Rowling documentary from that iteration as well.

The code will thus output this, only listing Harry Potter books and movies:

```swift
All medium with a title starting with 'Harry Potter'
 - [Book] Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
 - [Movie] Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
 - [Book] Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
 - [Movie] Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
 - [Book] Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
 - [Movie] Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
```

Using neither pattern matching nor any `where` clause nor syntactic sugar that we learned in this article series, the code might have looked like this instead:

```swift
print("All mediums with a title and starting with 'Harry Potter'")
for media in mediaList {
  guard let title = media.title else {
    continue
  }
  guard title.hasPrefix("Harry Potter") else {
    continue
  }
  print(" - [\(media.kind)] \(title)")
}
```

Some might find it more readable, but you can't argue that using `for case let (title?, kind) in â€¦ where â€¦`  is really powerful and allow you to ~~impress your friends~~ make great use of for loops + pattern matching + `where` clauses altogether. âœ¨

## Conclusion

This is the end of this "Pattern Matching" series.
