This month, I'm going to talk at ([NSSpain](http://2016.nsspain.com) and [FrenchKit](http://frenchkit.fr)) about Swift ðŸŽ‰ I'm looking forward to speak for the first time at such great conferences, and I really hope to see you there!

## Talking at NSSpain & FrenchKit

This post is just a quickie to do a small announcement, in case you didn't see me announce it on Twitter a few month ago.

This month, I'm going to give my first big conference talks. People who know me already know I don't have any problem talking a lot in public ðŸ˜‡ and I've already talked in meetings like CocoaHeads, but that will be the first time I'll speak at big conferences.

And for my first time, I already chose quite a challenge:

* My first talk will be at [NSSpain](http://2016.nsspain.com), on Sept 15-16, 2016
* My second talk will be at [FrenchKit](http://frenchkit.fr), on the week right after (Sept 23-24)

The first talk will be quite a challenge for me, because it will be my first big conference, speaking in English (not my language), in a foreign country, but more importantly doing not just slides but mostly live-coding â€” with Swift 3â€¦ so in Xcode 8 beta ðŸ˜± yeah I too like to live dangerously! â€” and about a subject that I haven't talked about in my blog or elsewhere yet ðŸ˜“. Yeah, that's a lot of potential obstacles for my first talk, but hey, I'm up for the challenge!

The second one will probably be easier, first because I'll already have th experience from the first one, but also because it will be in my country ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, with slides and not live-coding, and on a subject I already talked about. But hey, you never know how events could turn once on stage, and especially given how talkative I can be, I hope I'll fit into the 30 minutes window that I've been allocated!

I'm not sure I'm entirely ready for those ðŸ˜° but nevertheless I really can't wait to meet a lot of people there and be part of that adventure ðŸŽ‰! I really enjoyed going to conferences last year as an attendee, so this time going as a speaker I really think this is going to be even more amazing!

_This also explains why I haven't been very present the last few weeks, quite busy preparing my talksâ€¦ but worry not, I haven't forgotten about the part 2 of my last article about [Closure Capture Semantics](/swift/closures/2016/07/25/closure-capture-1/) and will hopefully resume my blogging around october after that!_

I can't wait to see a lot of awesome people at NSSpain and FrenchKit, and if you come to one of these conferences, don't hesitate to come and say hello! ðŸ‘‹
